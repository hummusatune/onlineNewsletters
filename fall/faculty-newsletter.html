          <h3>Things to Remember for the Start of the Semester</h3>
        </section>
        <section class="hover-reveal">
          <h4><strong>1. Publish, Publish, Publish</strong></h4>
          <p>Your students won’t have access to your course(s) content until your course semester start date has passed and you've hit publish. This can be a bittersweet function in Canvas if you have proactive students but aren’t yet ready for the semester.</p>
          <p>Many students check Canvas first thing Monday morning at the start of a new semester to see if their courses have any content (syllabus, assignment list, etc.) in order to begin planning for the weeks ahead.</p>
          <p>You can help students out and save time answering student questions by having something as simple as a welcome message in Canvas.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re teaching online courses, you absolutely should have content ready and published by the first day of classes (August 31st).</p>
          <p><strong>Draft State</strong></p>
          <p>Speaking of publishing, Canvas has a feature called Draft State that allows instructors to include unpublished content within a published Canvas course.</p>
          <p>This means any new content you create for your Canvas course - Assignments, Discussions, Pages, Quizzes, even Modules - will need to be published before students can see it.</p>
          <p><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/m/4152/l/57126-how-do-i-publish-my-course" target="_blank"><strong>For a quick guide on how to publish your course, check out this Canvas help guide.</strong></a></p>
          <p><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/searches?utf8=%E2%9C%93&text=Draft+state&commit=Search" target="_blank"><strong>For more info on how Draft State works with Assignments, Discussions, Pages, Quizzes, and Modules, check this out.</strong></a></p>
          <h4><strong>2. Testing for Distance Students</strong></h4>
          <!-- <img src="img/distantStudent.jpg" alt="a distant student" class="center-image"> -->
          <p>Some of your students may live outside the Weber, Morgan, and Davis county area, out-of-state, or even out-of-country. It's important to provide them with information for proctored testing as early as possible so they are able to secure proctors and have them approved.</p>
          <p><strong>How to Configure your Chi Tester tests for remote proctoring: </strong></p>
          <p>If you would like to deliver your tests to remote students through a secure testing proctor, be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make your test available at the 'Remote Proctors' site. This can be set on the "Sites" tab in Exam Parameters.</li>
            <li>Encourage your students to set up their proctors early! This process can take up to two weeks the first time. It's really in your students' best interest to get their proctor located and approved early in the semester.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Please be aware that remote students pay their proctors on average $20 to $50 for EVERY exam they take for your course. If a student has four courses that each has an average of ten proctored exams, that could be roughly $2,000 in testing fees!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We are happy to discuss your exam's settings with you and offer recommendations to ensure they allow exactly the student access you want them to allow.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://chitester.wordpress.com/chi-tester-contact-us/" target="_blank">If you are unsure of whether or not you have set up your test correctly, we encourage you to contact Chi Tester Support.</a></strong></p>
          <p><a title="Distance Student Chi Tester Instructions" href="http://chitester.wordpress.com/section-6-student-guide/remote-proctors/" target="_blank"><strong>More information about testing for distance students is available in the Chi Tester Users' Manual.</strong></a></p>
          <h4><strong>3. Get Your Dates Straight</strong></h4>
          <p>Canvas has two assignment settings that may cause confusion in your courses: Due Dates and Available From/Until Dates.</p>
          <p>Due dates tell students when assignments are expected to be submitted. But unless an available from/until date is also used, students will be able to submit an assignment after a due date has passed.</p>
          <p>The only way to limit submissions is to use the available from/until date option in addition to the due date.</p>
          <p><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/m/4152/l/73044-what-is-the-difference-between-due-dates-and-availability-dates" target="_blank"><strong>Here’s a guide on the differences between due dates and availability dates if you’re curious.</strong></a></p>
          <p>Be sure to double check your assignment settings because these dates occasionally get muddled when copied over from previous semesters. And with Canvas’ new Differentiated Assignments feature, things can get even more interesting if you’re not careful.</p>

          <h3>What's New in Canvas?</h3>
        </section>
        <section class="hover-reveal">
          <p>As far as Canvas changes go, summer has been all about squashing bugs, refining core Canvas functions, and reading by the pool.</p>
          <p>Here's a quick recap of the biggest changes that happened from June until now:</p>
          <h4><strong>1. Differentiated Assignments</strong></h4>
            <p>Instructors now have the ability to differentiate assignments among sections and even individual students.</p>
            <p>In the Gradebook, assignment grade cells are grayed out for students who are not part of the section or individuals who aren't part of the assignment. Assignments are not factored into overall grades if they aren't specifically assigned to a student or a section.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> On the student grades page, students can only view assignments that are assigned to them.</p>
          <h4><strong>2. Speaking of Grades...Excuse Them</strong></h4>
            <p>Instructors can excuse students from assignments. Just put an EX in a cell in the Gradebook and that student will be excused.</p>
            <p>Students can be excused from Group Assignments; the other members of the group will still be able to do their work and submit the assignment.</p>
          <h4><strong>3. Modules Can Be Marked as Done</strong></h4>
            <p>Instructors can assign Mark as Done as a module requirement for course assignments and pages. This change helps students keep track of their progress in Modules. For instance, an instructor may want a student to review a page multiple times before progressing to the next module item, or the requirement can also be used on assignments that are purely for self studying.</p>
          <h4><strong>4. Anonymous Peer Reviews</strong></h4>
            <p>The anonymity option now hides student names to avoid biased peer reviews. The submitting student’s name is hidden from the reviewer and any linked observers on the reviewer’s dashboard and the assignment submission page.</p>
          <h4><strong>5. Student Interactions Report</strong></h4>
          	<p>Instructors who access the People page in their course have a corresponding button to the Student Interactions Report.</p>
          	<img src="img/studentInteractions1.png" alt="the student interactions report button in the Canvas People link">
          	<p>The Student Interactions Report shows an overview of the last interaction with each student in their course, in addition to the student’s current score, final score, and any ungraded assignments. Basically a great overview for the course.</p>
          	<img src="img/studentInteractions2.png" alt="the student interactions report button in the Canvas People link">

          <h3>Your Canvas Courses Are Here</h3>
        </section>
        <section class="hover-reveal">
          <img src="img/whereRmyCourses.jpg" alt="a woman searching under the bed for her Canvas courses">
              <p>All Fall semester courses are now available in Canvas. If you are missing a course, let us know so we can make it available. Students will have access to their Canvas courses on the first day of classes. You absolutely should have content ready (and PUBLISHED) for your online courses by the first day.</p>
              <p>Please note, enrollments will not be pushed from Banner to Canvas until 2 days before the start of the semester (Saturday, August 29th) so you may see some discrepancies between your Banner and Canvas rosters.</p>
              <p>Should your rosters still differ by the end of the first week of Fall semester, please contact WSU Online at (801) 626-6499 or <strong><a href="mailto:wsuonline@weber.edu">wsuonline@weber.edu</a></strong>.</p>

          <h3>You Can Change Your Canvas Course Start and End Dates</h3>
        </section>
        <section class="hover-reveal">
          <p>If you'd like to allow students access to your course before the semester start date (August 31st, 2015), you can manually change the start date in your Canvas course. This will override the default term start date.</p>
          <p>Likewise, you can also change the end date in your course. Your students are unable to submit work in your course after the course end date, which is usually the last day of the semester, so be sure your due dates correspond accordingly.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> if you leave your end date blank in your course, it will default to the term end date. And be sure to check the box that reads, "Users can only participate in the course between these dates" so that your start and end dates work properly.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/m/4152/l/57088-how-do-i-change-the-start-and-end-dates-for-my-course" target="_blank">Check out this Canvas help guide if you want to know more.</strong></a>.</p>

          <h3>How to Crosslist Canvas Courses</h3>
        </section>
        <section class="hover-reveal">
          <p>Instructors have the ability to cross-list (e.g. merge/combine) their courses in Canvas. If you teach multiple sections of the same course (content, assessments, etc.), consider cross-listing your courses so that you only need to update one course.</p>
          <p>Review our <strong><a href="https://ciie.weber.edu/newsletters/img/howToCrossList.pdf" target="_blank">How to Cross-list</a></strong> document to determine if cross-listing is right for you and to see instructions on how to go about doing it.</p>

          <p>The eLearning Certificate Program is a new faculty professional development program being offered by the Center for Institutional and Instructional Effectiveness (CIIE). The program is meant to assist professors interested in cultivating exemplary online and blended courses by combining our former Master Online Teacher Certification and Blended Learning Program.</p>
          <p>Cool.</p>
          <p>Faculty can receive a certification in one of two tracks, blended or online, by participating in an online course, face-to-face workshops, and hands-on training. The faculty selected for this program will learn valuable tools and concepts to increase the interactivity and pedagogical expertise of their courses.</p>
          <p><strong>Applications for the first cohort will be accepted in Spring 2016.</strong></p>

          <h3>We Can Help You Build Your Online Syllabus</h3>

          <img src="img/construction.jpg" alt="a distant student" class="center-image">
          <p>The course syllabus is the one of the first opportunities your students have to get to know you. You can add documentation that will make your policies very clear to students.</p>
          <p>Here are a few suggestions:</p>
          <p><strong>Instructor Contact Information</strong></p>
          <p>Please advise your students of your preferred method of contact. For example, do you prefer Canvas email, Gmail (weber.edu), phone, etc.? You might consider an alternative contact method should the first be unavailable.</p>
          <p>Also, inform your students of the expected turn around time for your email response. Will you check your email once a day or every other day? The number one complaint we get from online students is faculty that don't respond to emails in a timely manner (or ever).</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Support Contact Information</strong></p>
          <p>For assistance with Canvas related technical issues, please call 801-626-6499. This phone is staffed Mon-Thurs from 8am - 5pm and Fridays from 8 - 4:30pm. A message can be left during non-business hours for a return call. Alternatively, students can send an email message to <strong><a href="mailto:wsuonline@weber.edu">wsuonline@weber.edu</a></strong>.</p>
          <p>For assistance with Chi Tester issues please email them at <strong><a href="mailto:chitester@weber.edu">chitester@weber.edu</a></strong> or call 801-626-6477. This phone is also staffed Mon-Thurs from 8am - 5pm and Fridays from 8 - 4:30pm. A message can be left during non-business hours for a return call.</p>
          <p>If students have technical issues related to usernames/passwords, please call the WSU Help Desk at 801-626-7777, or email <strong><a href="mailto:csupport@weber.edu">csupport@weber.edu</a></strong>.</p>
          <p>We'd like to recommend that you include support information on the home page footer of all of your Online and Web Enhanced courses. Here is an example:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"For Technical Support contact:</p>
            <p>801-626-7777 or csupport@weber.edu (username/password/login issues)</p>
            <p>801-626-6499 or wsuonline@weber.edu (Canvas issues)</p>
            <p>801-626-6477 or chitester@weber.edu (Chi Tester issues)"</p></blockquote>
          <p><strong>Accommodations for students with disabilities</strong></p>
          <p>Feel free to use this verbiage for keeping your course accessible:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Any student requiring accommodations or services due to a disability must contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) in room 181 of the Student Services Center. SSD can also arrange to provide course materials (including the syllabus) in alternative formats if necessary."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>For more information see the <strong><a href="http://www.weber.edu/ssd/" target="_blank">SSD website</a></strong> or contact their office at 801-626-6413.</p>
          <p><strong>Ethical Conduct and Plagiarism</strong></p>
          <p>Please provide expectations and penalties for academic dishonesty; be specific about whether and to what extent collaboration among students is appropriate. For example:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Any form of academic dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism, etc.) will not be tolerated. Proof of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade (E) for the course."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Please note: if you are planning to use turnitin.com, the plagiarism detection software WSU uses, we suggest you include that information in your syllabus. See our example statement below. Note: the Turnitin license has been renewed through June 2015 and is integrated with Canvas.
            <ul>
              <li>For more information and just-in-time training from Turnitin.com, please see their <strong><a href="http://www.turnitin.com/en_us/training/getting-started" target="_blank">Getting Started page</a></strong>.</li>
            </ul></p>
          <p><strong>Turnitin Syllabus Statement</strong></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"WSU subscribes to TurnItIn.com, an electronic service that verifies the originality of student work. Enrollment in this course may require you to submit some or all of your assignments to it this semester, and documents submitted to TurnItIn.com are retained, anonymously, in their databases.

          <h3>Make Your Courses Clearer With Learning Outcomes</h3>
        </section>
        <section class="hover-reveal">
          <p>Faculty are encouraged to include explicit learning outcomes in their course syllabi. Displaying course learning outcomes in the syllabus helps students understand course goals and objectives. Articulated outcomes also provide students with a sound understanding of how they will be assessed during the course.</p>
          <p>Here are a couple of examples of learning outcomes:
            <ul>
                <li>"Students will be able to clearly write an appropriate introduction to the main report."</li>
                <li>"Students will summarize the problem, question, or issue appropriately."</li>
