        <h3>How to Get Ready for Fall Semester</h3>
        <h4><strong>1. Update Your Stuff</strong></h4>
          <p>Canvas performs well in Chrome and Firefox browsers so please take a minute now to make sure you have at least one of them available. Using an unsupported browser will have an impact on your ability to use Canvas. If you are unsure which browser or which version of the browser you are using please go to <a href="http://whatbrowser.org/" target="_blank"><strong>http://whatbrowser.org/.</strong></a></p>
          <p><strong>Microsoft Edge Users</strong> - submitting assignments via Microsoft Edge is currently not working in Canvas. Please use Chrome or Firefox until further notice.</p>
          <p>Canvas also uses Flash and the Java plug-in occasionally, so make sure these are both up-to-date as well.</p>
          <p>To update your system and for more information, check out this <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1284" target="_blank"><strong>helpful Canvas guide.</strong></a></p>
        <h4><strong>2. Don't Worry About Your Missing Course Yet</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>The majority of online courses will be available Monday, August 29th.</strong></p>
          <p>If you verify that you are enrolled in courses through the eWeber portal then your courses should show up by Monday.</p>
          <p>If you try accessing your course on or after August 29th and it does not appear in your Courses list, it could be due to a variety of reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The course doesn't start at the beginning of the semester.</strong> Check the class schedule at <a href="https://weber.edu" target="_blank"><strong>weber.edu</strong></a> as some courses have different start dates.</li>
            <li><strong>It's a face-to-face course.</strong> Not all instructors use Canvas so it may be that your instructor isn’t using the system this semester. Contact your instructor to be sure.</li>
            <li><strong>You registered for the course that day.</strong> There is a short gap between when you register for a course and when it appears in your course list. If it’s been longer than an hour and you still aren't seeing your course, there may be an issue. Contact us.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If it’s an online course that starts at the beginning of the semester and you’ve been registered for it for more than 24 hours, please click the <strong>Help</strong> link in Canvas and compose a message indicating the course name, instructor, and 5 digit CRN of the course displaying the message – example: ENGL 1010 – Professor X – CRN 86753.</p>
        <h4><strong>3. Back Up Your Assignments</strong></h4>
          <p>It is always a good idea to have a copy of any submissions on your own computer. <strong>For your own sanity, make a backup of the work you submit.</strong></p>
          <p>In addition, if your response needs to be entered into a text box (such as a discussion entry), <strong>Canvas DOES NOT autosave in text boxes.</strong> Be sure to type your answer in a program that will allow you to save (such as Microsoft Word) and then copy and paste your response from the document into the Canvas text box.</p>
          <p>We can't suggest it enough. Keep copies of any assignment submissions just in case.</p>
        <h4><strong>4. Be Prepared to Take Distance Exams</strong></h4>
          <p>Students taking online courses or independent study courses who cannot come to the campus for testing may need to setup a proctor. Your instructor will let you know if this is necessary. <a href="https://chitester.weber.edu/manual/section-6-student-guide/remote-proctors/" target="_blank"><strong>Information about testing for distance students is available here.</strong></a></p>
          <p>If you are a distance student (outside of Weber, Davis, and Morgan counties), <strong>do not delay in setting up a proctor</strong>. Please be aware that many proctors charge for their services.</p>
          <p>We hope these tips help make your semester much easier. Keep reading for more awesome articles and helpful tips.</p>
        <h4><strong>5. Get Your Textbooks Here</strong></h4>
          <p>Go to <strong><a href="http://wsu.secureweblogin.com/" target="_blank">WSU's Bookstore</a></strong> for course text books. When you login, it should pull up a list of text books needed for your courses.</p>

        <h3>How To Access Your Online Courses</h3>
        <img src="img/eWeberPortal.png" alt="the WSU Online icon in the eWeber portal" style="border: solid 1px black;">
        <p>You can access your online courses through the eWeber Student Portal. Going through the portal provides you with notification of pending password expiration (passwords expire every 120 days).</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <strong><a href="http://weber.edu" target="_blank">http://weber.edu</a></strong></li>
          <li>Login with your Wildcat username and password</li>
          <li>You can search for portal apps by name at the top of the eWeber portal OR locate the "WSU Online - Canvas" app listed under the Featured category.</li>
          <li>Once you find the app in the eWeber portal, you can add it to your list of favorites.</li>
          <li>Please note that if you want to move between classes it is not necessary to log out of WSU Online and back through the portal. Simply mouse over "Courses" in the upper left navigation in Canvas and then locate and select the next course.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>If the eWeber portal isn't available, do this:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <strong><a href="http://canvas.weber.edu" target="_blank">canvas.weber.edu</a></strong> OR <strong><a href="http://weber.instructure.com" target="_blank">weber.instructure.com</a></strong></li>
          <li>Log in with your Wildcat username and password.</li>
          <li>On the resulting Canvas dashboard, mouse over "Courses" to locate the course you want to access and click that link.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Access Canvas 24 Hours a Day</h3>
        <p>It is our goal to maintain service as consistently and reliably as possible. In general, Canvas and the eWeber portal are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
        <p>On occasion, a maintenance outage must be scheduled to accommodate updates.  Scheduled outages, though rare, will be announced on the Recent Activity page in your Canvas dashboard. You will need to plan accordingly.</p>
        <p>WSU maintains notification on the IT Help Desk status message (801-626-7777). When an unplanned outage occurs, the highest priority is given to bringing the system back up. You can help yourself by not leaving your work to the last minute.</p>
        <p>And finally, there are a variety of HELP options available within Canvas. Simply click the HELP link at the bottom left of the dashboard if you're having problems in Canvas.</p>
