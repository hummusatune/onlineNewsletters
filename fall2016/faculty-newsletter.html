          <h4><strong>Check Your Course List in Canvas</strong></h4>
            <p>All Fall semester courses are now available in Canvas and should show up in your list. If you are missing a course, let us know so we can track it down. Students will have access to their Canvas courses on the first day of classes. You absolutely should have content ready (and PUBLISHED) for your online courses by the first day.</p>
            <p>Please note, enrollments will not be pushed from Banner to Canvas until 2 days before the start of the semester (Saturday, August 27th) so you may see some discrepancies between your Banner and Canvas rosters before this date.</p>
            <p>Should your rosters still differ by the end of the first week of Fall semester, please contact WSU Online Canvas Support at (801) 626-6499 or <strong><a href="mailto:wsuonline@weber.edu">wsuonline@weber.edu</a></strong>.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1270" target="_blank">Here's a guide on how to view your Canvas courses.</a></strong></p>
            <p><strong><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1288" target="_blank">This guide shows you how to customize your Courses list.</a></strong></p>
          <h4><strong>Publish Whatever You Want Your Students to See</strong></h4>
            <p>Your students won’t have access to your course(s) content until your course semester start date has passed and you've hit publish. This can be a bittersweet function in Canvas if you have proactive students but aren’t yet ready for the semester.</p>
            <p>Many students check Canvas first thing Monday morning at the start of a new semester to see if their courses have any content (syllabus, assignment list, etc.) in order to begin planning for the weeks ahead.</p>
            <p>You can help students out and save time answering student questions by having something as simple as a welcome message in Canvas on the first day.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re teaching online courses, you absolutely should have content ready and published by the first day of classes (August 29th).</p>
            <p>Speaking of publishing, Canvas has a feature called Draft State that allows instructors to include unpublished content within a published Canvas course.</p>
            <p>This means any new content you create for your Canvas course - Assignments, Discussions, Pages, Quizzes, even Modules - will need to be published before students can see it.</p>
            <p><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/m/4152/l/57126-how-do-i-publish-my-course" target="_blank"><strong>Here's a quick guide on how to publish your course.</strong></a></p>
            <p><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/searches?utf8=%E2%9C%93&text=Draft+state&commit=Search" target="_blank"><strong>Here's a guide on how Draft State works with Assignments, Discussions, Pages, Quizzes, and Modules.</strong></a></p>
          <h4><strong>General Tips and Tricks</strong></h4>
            <ul class="boxList">
              <li>Check assignment due dates and availability dates. Use the calendar to quickly drag and drop them.</li>
              <li>You can grant students access to your course before the semester starts by changing the start date in your Canvas course Settings.</li>
              <li>You can also change the course end date. Your students are unable to submit work in your course after the end date, which is usually the last day of the semester, so be sure your due dates correspond accordingly if you do this.</li>
              <li>Check the box that reads, "Users can only participate in the course between these dates" so that your start and end dates work properly.</li>
              <li>Use 11:59 pm instead of 12:00 am. Midnight is the start of the day you specify, not the end.</li>
              <li>If using Chi Tester, check course associations and delivery dates.</li>
              <li>Check major links and multimedia (images, videos, etc.) to ensure they function.</li>
              <li>Use Student View in Course Settings to check if your course navigation and design work well.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>What's New in Canvas?</h3>
          <p>Here's a quick recap of major changes in Canvas the last few months. Keep that teaching game fresh.</p>
          <h4><strong>1. Big Changes to Turnitin</strong></h4>
            <p>Previously, instructors created Turnitin assignments by checking the Turnitin checkbox option within a Canvas assignment. This functionality will be phased out starting Spring 2017, so we're urging instructors to use Fall semester to implement and get familiar with the new Turnitin assignment process.</p>
            <p><strong><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1799" target="_blank">Here's a new guide on how to create a Turnitin assignment in Canvas.</strong></a></p>
            <p>Please bookmark this guide. We, along with many institutions, implored Canvas and Turnitin to keep the assignment process as similar as possible and will continue to add our feedback to improve Turnitin functionality in Canvas.</p>
            <p>We will also keep instructors up-to-date on Turnitin timelines and plans for Spring 2017. Please start using the new process above as soon as possible.</p>
          <h4><strong>2. Final Grade Exclusion in Assignments</strong></h4>
            <p>As part of creating or editing an assignment, instructors can choose whether or not assignments count toward the final grade. This feature allows instructors to provide feedback without an assignment counting toward Gradebook calculations. The option to remove assignments from the final grade can be changed at any time on a per-assignment basis.</p>
            <p>NOTE: This feature is only available in assignments; it does not apply to graded discussions or quizzes.</p>
            <p>When an assignment is removed from total grade calculations, the assignment displays a banner in the assignments page and assignment details page indicating that the assignment does not apply to the final grade.</p>
            <p>The Gradebook displays a warning icon for assignments that do not apply to the final grade. Selected assignments are excluded from Gradebook calculations in the Total Grade column.</p>
          <h4><strong>3. Read-only Submissions Folder</strong></h4>
            <p>When a student uploads a file for an assignment, or if a student uses a file that is already uploaded in his or her user files, Canvas copies the file submission into a new User Files folder called Submissions. Indicated by a lock icon, this read-only folder contains all the student’s assignment submission files. The Submissions folder is organized into subfolders according to course name; files cannot be moved or deleted, but students can preview and download the files. Submission folder files are not counted against the user files quota.</p>
          <h4><strong>4. SpeedGrader UI Updates</strong></h4>
            <p>The primary navigation buttons have been moved to the right side of the menu bar to be more closely associated with the most frequently used features in SpeedGrader. Navigating from student to student is now located directly above the sidebar.</p>
            <p>The less frequently used navigation buttons have been moved to the left side of the menu bar: return to the Gradebook, mute the assignment, view keyboard shortcuts, view the help menu, and change Gradebook settings. These are now icons. Assignment details (assignment name, due date, and course name) and grading statistics are in the middle of the menu bar.</p>
          <h4><strong>5. SpeedGrader Comment Drafts</strong></h4>
            <p>If an instructor creates a comment in SpeedGrader and navigates to another submission without submitting the comment, or refreshes the page, SpeedGrader autosaves the comment and notifies the instructor it has been saved as a draft. The instructor can go back to the student’s submission and submit the comment at a later time. Comments cannot be viewed by students when in draft.</p>
            <p>Note: Currently, draft comments cannot be edited, but they can be deleted or submitted at any time.</p>
          <h4><strong>5. Gradebook Enrollment Settings</strong></h4>
            <p>SpeedGrader displays assignment submissions for students according to the enrollment settings in the Gradebook. If an instructor displays inactive enrollments in the Gradebook, SpeedGrader shows inactive student submissions as part of the SpeedGrader student drop-down menu. Likewise, if an instructor displays concluded enrollments in the Gradebook, SpeedGrader shows concluded student submissions.</p>
            <p>Note: Students who withdraw from courses will show up as Concluded Enrollments.</p>
          <h4><strong>Want to know when Canvas changes?</strong></h4>

      <p>Some of your students may live outside the Weber, Morgan, and Davis county area, out-of-state, or even out-of-country. It's important to provide them with information for proctored testing as early as possible so they are able to secure proctors and have them approved.</p>
          <p><strong>How to Configure your Chi Tester tests for remote proctoring: </strong></p>
          <p>If you would like to deliver your tests to remote students through a secure testing proctor, be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make your test available at the Remote Proctors' site. This can be set on the "Sites" tab in Exam Parameters.</li>
            <li>Encourage your students to set up their proctors early! This process can take up to two weeks the first time. It's really in your students' best interest to get their proctor located and approved early in the semester.</li>
            <li><strong>Note: Please be aware that remote students pay their proctors on average $20 to $50 for EVERY exam they take for your course.</strong> If a student has four courses that each has an average of ten proctored exams, it could be roughly $2,000 in testing fees!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We are happy to discuss your exam's settings with you and offer recommendations to ensure they allow exactly the student access you want them to allow.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="https://chitester.weber.edu/manual/chi-tester-contact-us/" target="_blank">If you are unsure of whether or not you have set up your test correctly, we encourage you to contact Chi Tester Support.</a></strong></p>
