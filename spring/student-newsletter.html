        <h3>4 Things for the Start of the Semester</h3>
        <h4><strong>1. Update Your Stuff</strong></h4>
        <p>Canvas performs well in Chrome and Firefox browsers so please take a minute now to make sure you have at least one of them available. Using an unsupported browser will have an impact on your ability to use Canvas. If you are unsure which browser or which version of the browser you are using please go to <a href="http://whatbrowser.org/" target="_blank"><strong>http://whatbrowser.org/.</strong></a></p>
        <p>Canvas also uses Flash and the Java plug-in occasionally, so make sure these are both up-to-date as well.</p>
        <p>To update your system and for more information, check out this <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1284" target="_blank"><strong>helpful Canvas guide.</strong></a></p>
        <h4><strong>2. Don't Worry About Your Missing Course Yet</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>The majority of online courses will be available Monday, January 11th.</strong></p>
        <p>Because of an update within Canvas, future enrollments are not showing up in Canvas until the semester start date. If you verify that you are enrolled in courses through the eWeber portal then your courses should show up by Monday.</p>
        <p>If you try accessing your course on or after January 11th and it does not appear in your Courses dropdown list, it could be due to a variety of reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Does the course start at the beginning of the semester?</strong> Check the class schedule at <a href="https://weber.edu" target="_blank"><strong>weber.edu</strong></a> as some courses have different start dates.</li>
          <li><strong>Is it a face-to-face course?</strong> Not all instructors use Canvas so it may be that your instructor isn’t using the system this semester. Contact your instructor to be sure.</li>
          <li><strong>Did you register for the course the same day?</strong> There is a short gap between when you register for a course and when it appears in your course list. If it’s been longer than an hour and you still aren't seeing your course, there may be an issue. Contact us.</li>
          <li>If it’s an online course that starts at the beginning of the semester and you’ve been registered for it for more than 24 hours, please click the <strong>Help</strong> link in Canvas and compose a message indicating the course name, instructor, and 5 digit CRN of the course displaying the message – example: ENGL 1010 – Professor X – CRN 86753.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>3. Back Up Your Assignments</strong></h4>
        <p>It is always a good idea to have a copy of any submissions on your own computer. <strong>For your own sanity, make a backup of the work you submit.</strong></p>
        <p>In addition, if your response needs to be entered into a text box (such as a discussion entry), <strong>Canvas DOES NOT autosave in text boxes.</strong> Be sure to type your answer in a program that will allow you to save (such as Microsoft Word) and then copy and paste your response from the document into the Canvas text box.</p>
        <p>We can't suggest it enough. Keep copies of any assignment submissions just in case.</p>
        <h4><strong>4. Be Prepared to Take Distance Exams</strong></h4>
        <p>Students taking online courses or independent study courses who cannot come to the campus for testing may need to setup a proctor. Your instructor will let you know if this is necessary. <a href="http://chitester.wordpress.com/section-6-student-guide/remote-proctors/" target="_blank"><strong>Information about testing for distance students is available here.</strong></a></p>
        <p>If you are a distance student (outside of Weber, Davis, and Morgan counties), <strong>do not delay in setting up a proctor</strong>. Please be aware that many proctors charge for their services.</p>
        <p>We hope these tips help make your semester much easier. Keep reading for more awesome articles and helpful tips.</p>

        <h3>How To Access Your Online Courses</h3>
        <img src="img/eWeberPortal.png" alt="the WSU Online icon in the eWeber portal" style="border: solid black 1px;">
        <p>You can access your online courses through the eWeber Student Portal. Going through the portal provides you with notification of pending password expiration (passwords expire every 120 days).</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <strong><a href="http://weber.edu" target="_blank">http://weber.edu</a></strong></li>
          <li>Login with your Wildcat username and password</li>
          <li>You can search for portal apps by name at the top of the eWeber portal OR locate the "WSU Online - Canvas" app listed under the Featured category.</li>
          <li>Once you find the app in the eWeber portal, you can add it to your list of favorites.</li>
          <li>Please note that if you want to move between classes it is not necessary to log out of WSU Online and back through the portal. Simply mouse over "Courses" in the upper left navigation in Canvas and then locate and select the next course.</li>
        </ol>
      <p><strong>If the student portal is not available, follow these steps to access your online classes:</strong>
      <img src="img/canvasLogIn.png" alt="WSU's Canvas log in icon"></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <strong><a href="http://canvas.weber.edu" target="_blank">canvas.weber.edu</a></strong> OR <strong><a href="http://weber.instructure.com" target="_blank">weber.instructure.com</a></strong></li>
          <li>Log in with your Wildcat username and password</li>
          <li>On the resulting Canvas dashboard, mouse over "Courses" to locate the course you want to access and click that link</li>

     <h3>Canvas Course Hacks from Current Students</h3>
      <h4><strong>1. Find the main points of interest in your course</strong></h4>
      <p>Instructors at WSU can design their courses a variety of different ways so you may see that one course is vastly different from another course, sometimes even in the same area of study.</p>
      <p>Just like visiting a new city, make sure you search out all the important areas of your Canvas course when you first get there.</p>
      <p>Check out the side navigation links. Briefly browse through some of the course pages and see where the page links go. Look at Modules, if they’re available, and look at the Assignments list.</p>
      <img src="img/courseNav.png" alt="the course navigation links inside Canvas">
      <p>Get a feel for the course because in Canvas, there may be three or four different ways to get to where you need to go.</p>
      <p>For example, some courses use Modules to store content and assignments while others keep assignments only in the Assignment area. Some just use the Syllabus.</p>
      <p>If any parts of your course seem confusing, don’t be afraid to reach out to your fellow students and your instructor.</p>
      <h4><strong>2. Be ready for group work and peer review assignments</strong></h4>
      <p>Canvas makes group and peer review assignments fairly simple to do if you know what to look for.</p>
      <img src="img/viewGroups.png" alt="the courses and groups link inside Canvas">
      <p>To find which groups you’re a part of, click the Courses and Groups link [1] at the top of your Canvas dashboard. The groups you are enrolled in will appear to the right of your course enrollments [2].</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-4121#jive_content_id_People_and_Groups" target="_blank">You can do all sorts of things inside a Canvas course group to get your work done.</a></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Peer review</strong></p>
      <img src="img/peerReviewToDo.png" alt="the peer review icons found in Canvas indicating you have a peer review to do">
      <p>Peer review assignments differ from group assignments in that you’ll be asked to grade one or more student submissions from other students in your course. Not just a small group.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-3139" target="_blank">This is how you’ll know when you have a peer review due.</a></strong></p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-3138" target="_blank">And this is how you’ll actually submit the peer review assignment.</a></strong></p>
      <h4><strong>3. Use the View All or Customize link to organize your course list</strong></h4>
      <img src="img/viewAllLink.png" alt="the View All or Customize link inside Canvas is under the Courses heading">
      <p>If you click on the View All or Customize link in your Courses dropdown, you may see a large list of courses grouped by date of enrollment.</p>
      <p>Courses are organized into two categories: My Courses and Past Enrollments [2].</p>
      <p>If the semester hasn’t started yet, your future enrollments will only show up if the course opens early. Otherwise, they'll appear on the first day of class. Current courses are in My Courses.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1288" target="_blank">You can customize your dropdown list by adding a star next to a course.</a></strong></p>
      <p>Notice this will also tell you if a course is <strong>unpublished</strong> or not. If a course is unpublished, it means your instructor may still be working on it or isn’t using Canvas for this course.</p>

      <p>On occasion, a maintenance outage must be scheduled to accommodate updates.  Scheduled outages, though rare, will be announced on the Recent Activity page in your Canvas dashboard. You will need to plan accordingly.</p>
      <p>WSU maintains notification on the IT Help Desk status message (801-626-7777). When an unplanned outage occurs, the highest priority is given to bringing the system back up. You can help yourself by not leaving your work to the last minute.</p>

     <h3>What Do Instructors Expect From Online Students?</h3>
<p>1. Your instructor expects that you will login and be ready to begin on the first day of the semester. The first day of school brings with it a tremendous load on the IT systems on campus, so please be patient, but be persistent. Be sure to read the course syllabus and any other introductory material as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>2. Your instructor expects that you use the tools they have specified for the course. This may include messaging in Canvas, the ability to attach files and submit them, understand how discussions work, etc.</p>
      <p>3. Your instructor expects that you have the discipline to complete an online course. This means that you take responsibility for logging in to class on a regular basis and have the organizational skills to complete work on time.</p>
      <p>4. Finally, there is an expectation that you will take responsibility for resolving any issues you are having regarding the course. If you are having technical issues, contact one of our <a href="http://continue.weber.edu/wsuonline/contact.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>support numbers</strong></a>. If you are having issues with the course itself, you are expected to initiate contact with your instructor.</p>
      <p>We've gathered a few suggestions for a successful online learning experience from a group of seasoned online faculty:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Communicate, communicate, communicate...</li>
          <li>Log on frequently</li>
          <li>Print the syllabus for reference when Canvas or computer access isn't available</li>
          <li>Submit assignments early; don't wait until the last minute</li>
          <li>Make a time commitment; setup a schedule and stick to it</li>
          <li>If you don't use Wildcat Mail, setup a forwarding rule so mail sent there gets to you</li>
          <li><strong>Take time to read instructions carefully</strong></li>
        </ul>
