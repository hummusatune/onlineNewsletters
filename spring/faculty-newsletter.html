          <h3>What's New in Canvas?</h3>
          <p>Here's a quick recap of major changes in Canvas and some that will happen this Saturday, January 9th. Keep that teaching game fresh!</p>
          <h4><strong>1. Moderated Grading</strong></h4>
            <p>Moderated grading allows multiple reviewers (TAs) to grade a student’s work and create draft or provisional grades for an assignment. For instance, you may want to allow two TAs in your course to grade all assignments, and you can use their assessments to assign a final grade. This feature can also be used to create a sampling of students for assignment review to ensure grading is consistent and allows secondary grade reviews.</p>
        <p><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-5651" target="_blank">What is Moderated Grading?</a></p>
          <h4><strong>2. ePub Exports</strong></h4>
            <p>As an instructor, you can allow students to download your course as an ePub file. Students can view ePub content offline using an ePub reader.</p>
            <p>The default ePub organization is by module, meaning only items that students have access to view in each module will be included in the ePub file. Locked modules list either their pre-requisites or the unlock date, as well as the items that are contained within that module (though not the actual content of those items themselves). However, you can choose to set your course organization by content type (e.g. assignments, quizzes, etc.).</p>
        <p><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-5578" target="_blank">How do I change the format of a course ePub export file?</a></p>
          <h4><strong>3. Link Validator</strong></h4>
            <p>As an instructor, you can verify all external links throughout your course to ensure they are valid. You can check these links using the course link validator, which searches through course content and returns invalid or unresponsive external links in both published and unpublished content.</p>
      <p><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-5626" target="_blank">How do I validate links in a course?</a></p>  
          <h4><strong>4. Recurring Events in the Calendar</strong></h4>
            <p>A Canvas event is a non-graded Canvas activity. Events you create on the Calendar will not appear on the Assignments page or in the Gradebook. But they will show up on the Syllabus page and student calendars. You can create events with due date times as well as all-day events.</p>
        <p>If you want to create the same event multiple times for a course, you can create a recurring event. Recurring (or repeating) events creates multiple copies of the event every day, week, or month. Recurring events are only available for course calendars; they are not supported in personal calendars.</p>
        <p><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-4863" target="_blank">How do I add a recurring event to a course Calendar?</a></p>
          <h4><strong>5. Section-Limited Users</strong></h4>
          	<p>You can limit users to only see other users who are enrolled in the same section of a course. You can set limitations when adding a student to the course manually, or after they have already been added to the course.</p>
          	<p>Limiting students to interact by section only affects Collaborations, Chat, People, and Conversations. When enrolling instructors and TAs, section limitations allow those users to grade students in their same section(s). Discussion topics and Pages are not affected by section limitations and can be viewed by any student. These feature areas could be restricted by creating content in course groups. However, course groups cannot be organized by section and would have to be created manually.</p>
       <p><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-2879" target="_blank">How do I limit a user to only view other users in the same course section?</a></p>
        <h4><strong>6. Polling in Conferences</strong></h4>
        <p>Presenters can now create polls for participants during a conference. Presenters cannot participate in their own polls. Polls are anonymous, and participants are not required to complete a poll. Polls can be Yes/No, True/False, or letter responses up to six answer choices (A through F).</p>
       <p><a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-4854" target="_blank">How do I start a poll in a Conference?</a></p>
      <h4><strong>7. Remove Students from Message Students Who</strong></h4>
      <p>When using the Message Students Who feature in the Gradebook, instructors can remove student names that are shown in the student list. If a student is removed from the message list, the student will not receive the message.</p>
      <h4><strong>8. Edit Enrollment Type</strong></h4>
      <p>Admins and instructors can edit the enrollment type for a user in the course through the People page. Unlike section edits, role edits do not require the user to accept a new course invitation. This feature allows instructors to make modifications to course enrollment types without having to delete the existing enrollment.</p>
      <p>Note: Existing users cannot be edited to have an observer role. Additionally, existing observers cannot have their roles changed to any other role type. Observers can only be added by adding a new user to the course.</p>
      <h4><strong>Want to know when Canvas changes?</strong></h4>

          <h3 class="service-heading">Things to Remember for the Start of the Semester</h3>
  
          <p class="service-description">There's a lot to remember at the start of the semester. Here are three things that might save you time if you use Canvas and/or Chi Tester.</p></a>
			</div>

      <section class="large reveal" id="modalTwo" data-reveal>
          <h4><strong>1. Publish, Publish, Publish</strong></h4>
          <p>Your students won’t have access to your course(s) content until your course semester start date has passed and you've hit publish. This can be a bittersweet function in Canvas if you have proactive students but aren’t yet ready for the semester.</p>
          <p>Many students check Canvas first thing Monday morning at the start of a new semester to see if their courses have any content (syllabus, assignment list, etc.) in order to begin planning for the weeks ahead.</p>
          <p>You can help students out and save time answering student questions by having something as simple as a welcome message in Canvas.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re teaching online courses, you absolutely should have content ready and published by the first day of classes (January 11th).</p>
          <p><strong>Draft State</strong></p>
          <p>Speaking of publishing, Canvas has a feature called Draft State that allows instructors to include unpublished content within a published Canvas course.</p>
          <p>This means any new content you create for your Canvas course - Assignments, Discussions, Pages, Quizzes, even Modules - will need to be published before students can see it.</p>
          <p><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/m/4152/l/57126-how-do-i-publish-my-course" target="_blank"><strong>For a quick guide on how to publish your course, check out this Canvas help guide.</strong></a></p>
          <p><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/searches?utf8=%E2%9C%93&text=Draft+state&commit=Search" target="_blank"><strong>For more info on how Draft State works with Assignments, Discussions, Pages, Quizzes, and Modules, check this out.</strong></a></p>
          <h4><strong>2. Testing for Distance Students</strong></h4>
          <!-- <img src="img/distantStudent.jpg" alt="a distant student" class="center-image"> -->
          <p>Some of your students may live outside the Weber, Morgan, and Davis county area, out-of-state, or even out-of-country. It's important to provide them with information for proctored testing as early as possible so they are able to secure proctors and have them approved.</p>
          <p><strong>How to Configure your Chi Tester tests for remote proctoring: </strong></p>
          <p>If you would like to deliver your tests to remote students through a secure testing proctor, be sure to complete the following tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make your test available at the 'Remote Proctors' site. This can be set on the "Sites" tab in Exam Parameters.</li>
            <li>Encourage your students to set up their proctors early! This process can take up to two weeks the first time. It's really in your students' best interest to get their proctor located and approved early in the semester.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Please be aware that remote students pay their proctors on average $20 to $50 for EVERY exam they take for your course. If a student has four courses that each has an average of ten proctored exams, that could be roughly $2,000 in testing fees!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We are happy to discuss your exam's settings with you and offer recommendations to ensure they allow exactly the student access you want them to allow.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://chitester.wordpress.com/chi-tester-contact-us/" target="_blank">If you are unsure of whether or not you have set up your test correctly, we encourage you to contact Chi Tester Support.</a></strong></p>
          <p><a title="Distance Student Chi Tester Instructions" href="http://chitester.wordpress.com/section-6-student-guide/remote-proctors/" target="_blank"><strong>More information about testing for distance students is available in the Chi Tester Users' Manual.</strong></a></p>
          <h4><strong>3. Get Your Dates Figured</strong></h4>
          <p>Canvas has two assignment settings that may cause confusion in your courses: Due Dates and Available From/Until Dates.</p>
          <p>Due dates tell students when assignments are expected to be submitted. But unless an available from/until date is also used, students will be able to submit an assignment after a due date has passed.</p>
          <p>The only way to limit submissions is to use the available from/until date option in addition to the due date.</p>
          <p><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/m/4152/l/73044-what-is-the-difference-between-due-dates-and-availability-dates" target="_blank"><strong>Here’s a guide on the differences between due dates and availability dates if you’re curious.</strong></a></p>
          <p>Be sure to double check your assignment settings because these dates occasionally get muddled when copied over from previous semesters. And with Canvas’ new Differentiated Assignments feature, things can get even more interesting if you’re not careful.</p>

        <p>All Spring semester courses are now available in Canvas and should show up in your list. If you are missing a course, let us know so we can track it down. Students will have access to their Canvas courses on the first day of classes. You absolutely should have content ready (and PUBLISHED) for your online courses by the first day.</p>
        <p>Please note, enrollments will not be pushed from Banner to Canvas until 2 days before the start of the semester (Saturday, January 9th) so you may see some discrepancies between your Banner and Canvas rosters before this date.</p>

      <h3>You Can Change Your Canvas Course Start and End Dates</h3>
      <p>If you'd like to allow students access to your course before the semester start date (January 11th, 2016), you can manually change the start date in your Canvas course. This will override the default term start date.</p>
      <p>Likewise, you can also change the end date in your course. Your students are unable to submit work in your course after the course end date, which is usually the last day of the semester, so be sure your due dates correspond accordingly.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> if you leave your end date blank in your course, it will default to the term end date. And be sure to check the box that reads, "Users can only participate in the course between these dates" so that your start and end dates work properly.</p>

    <p>The eLearning Certificate Program is a new faculty professional development program being offered by the Center for Institutional and Instructional Effectiveness (CIIE). The program is meant to assist professors interested in cultivating exemplary online and blended courses by combining our former Master Online Teacher Certification and Blended Learning Program.</p>
    <p>Faculty can receive a certification in one of two tracks, blended or online, by participating in an online course, face-to-face workshops, and hands-on training. The faculty selected for this program will learn valuable tools and concepts to increase the interactivity and pedagogical expertise of their courses.</p>
    <p><strong>Applications for the next cohort will be accepted in March 2016.</strong></p>

      <p>The course syllabus is the one of the first opportunities your students have to get to know you. You can add documentation that will make your policies very clear to students.</p>
      <p>Here are a few suggestions:</p>
      <p><strong>Instructor Contact Information</strong></p>
      <p>Please advise your students of your preferred method of contact. For example, do you prefer Canvas email, Gmail (weber.edu), phone, etc.? You might consider an alternative contact method should the first be unavailable.</p>
      <p>Also, inform your students of the expected turn around time for your email response. Will you check your email once a day or every other day? The number one complaint we get from online students is faculty that don't respond to emails in a timely manner (or ever).</p>
      <p><strong>Technical Support Contact Information</strong></p>
      <p>For assistance with Canvas related technical issues, please call 801-626-6499. This phone is staffed Mon-Thurs from 8am - 5pm and Fridays from 8 - 4:30pm. A message can be left during non-business hours for a return call. Alternatively, students can send an email message to <strong><a href="mailto:wsuonline@weber.edu">wsuonline@weber.edu</a></strong>.</p>
      <p>For assistance with Chi Tester issues please email them at <strong><a href="mailto:chitester@weber.edu">chitester@weber.edu</a></strong> or call 801-626-6477. This phone is also staffed Mon-Thurs from 8am - 5pm and Fridays from 8 - 4:30pm. A message can be left during non-business hours for a return call.</p>
      <p>If students have technical issues related to usernames/passwords, please call the WSU Help Desk at 801-626-7777, or email <strong><a href="mailto:csupport@weber.edu">csupport@weber.edu</a></strong>.</p>
      <p>We'd like to recommend that you include support information on the home page footer of all of your Online and Web Enhanced courses. Here is an example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"For Technical Support contact:</p>
        <p>801-626-7777 or csupport@weber.edu (username/password/login issues)</p>
        <p>801-626-6499 or wsuonline@weber.edu (Canvas issues)</p>
        <p>801-626-6477 or chitester@weber.edu (Chi Tester issues)"</p></blockquote>
      <p><strong>Accommodations for students with disabilities</strong></p>
      <p>Feel free to use this verbiage for keeping your course accessible:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Any student requiring accommodations or services due to a disability must contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) in room 181 of the Student Services Center. SSD can also arrange to provide course materials (including the syllabus) in alternative formats if necessary."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For more information see the <strong><a href="http://www.weber.edu/ssd/" target="_blank">SSD website</a></strong> or contact their office at 801-626-6413.</p>
      <p><strong>Ethical Conduct and Plagiarism</strong></p>
      <p>Please provide expectations and penalties for academic dishonesty; be specific about whether and to what extent collaboration among students is appropriate. For example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Any form of academic dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism, etc.) will not be tolerated. Proof of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade (E) for the course."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Please note: if you are planning to use turnitin.com, the plagiarism detection software WSU uses, we suggest you include that information in your syllabus. See our example statement below. Note: the Turnitin license has been renewed through June 2015 and is integrated with Canvas.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For more information and just-in-time training from Turnitin.com, please see their <strong><a href="http://www.turnitin.com/en_us/training/getting-started" target="_blank">Getting Started page</a></strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      <p><strong>Turnitin Syllabus Statement</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"WSU subscribes to Turnitin, an electronic service that verifies the originality of student work. Enrollment in this course may require you to submit some or all of your assignments to it this semester, and documents submitted to TurnItIn.com are retained, anonymously, in their databases.

Displaying course learning outcomes in the syllabus helps students understand course goals and objectives. Articulated outcomes also provide students with a sound understanding of how they will be assessed during the course.</p>
      <p>Here are a couple of examples of learning outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Students will be able to clearly write an appropriate introduction to the main report."</li>
            <li>"Students will summarize the problem, question, or issue appropriately."</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Also, be sure to check out the <strong><a href="http://guides.instructure.com/m/4152/c/23857" target="_blank">Outcomes feature in Canvas</a></strong>.</p>
